---

This mod allows you to customize Madeline's trails, including frequency, duration, opacity, and more.

Three trail types are supported:

- Hair Color: The trail's color will follow Madeline's hair, like the playback ghosts in Farewell.

- [Onion Skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_skinning): The trail will use Madeline's sprite instead of an outline with color.
